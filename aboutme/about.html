    <p>Hi everyone, let me introduce myself and my family. I've been married to this lovely lady for almost
        10 years and the fruit of our love is this three little angel on the picture. We are from the Philippines
        and our family love to travel in different places to eat. My kids love japanese food especially ramen and tempura.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 11 years. I love the church because
        of it's principles that center on the family. Families should be forever.</p>    
    <p>Here in the Philippines, I am an engineer but discovering the blessing of working from home, I am eager to 
        shift my career as a software developer that is why I am taking up this course. I already have an experience working with 
    html, css and javascript but I want to gain the certificate to be able to find a better job. </p>
    <p>I enjoy learning new things with other people and I am looking forward to working with all of you.</p>
