                <h1>Hi! I am Richard Obnamia</h1>
                <p>I am a web developer based on the Philippines. I have started my career as a design engineer but as I do my day job, I have found task relating to codes which I really enjoyed the most. My interest started with just excel programming then my experience with HTML and CSS during my highschool days has earn me an opportunity in creating our company website which open an opportunity to learn more and feed my interest in using codes in creating beautiful and stunning websites. 
                </br></br>
                   I pursue this new found career and started learning more. So, if you are looking to have your own digital presence maybe its time to collaborate and make it possible. We can build your site in platform that you want although I am more familiar with Wordpress, Elementor and Bootstrap and I have plenty of experience in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript so we can modify it according to what you want. But if you are into funnels, I am also experience in drag and drop platform like Unbounce, Kajabi and GoHighLevel. 
                We can start now! Let's do some awesome projects and show what your ideas and business!. Just put in you information below.</p>
